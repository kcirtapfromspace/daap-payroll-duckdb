DAAP had <Value data={active_employees_monthly_stats} column=active_employees/> active employees in <Value data={active_employees_monthly_stats} column=month_name/>. This was a change of <Value data={active_employees_monthly_stats} column=active_employee_growth_pct1/> from <Value data={active_employees_monthly_stats} column=month_name row=1/>.
